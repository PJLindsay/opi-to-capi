Udemy Vue3 course Section 19

example of how to refactor from Options API (Vue2) to Composition API (Vue3)

## Concepts

relocating logic in setup() means it's easier to keep related methods/computed properties in
same location - a lot less scrolling when you have a larger/more complex component

Note: you can mix and match Options API with Composition API
example: UserItem.vue and BaseSearch.vue are using Options API (not migrated to Composition API)


## Installation

npm install


## Run

npm run serve (Development)
